# Fake Site - Coding Assessment Assigned by First Street

* **Critias and Instructions** 
    1. Build a fake website using `mockup.png` as your guide. The style guide is located in `StyleGuide.png`.
    2. Use Next.JS, React and components as best as you can.
    3. Use Styled-JSX for your css
    4. No mobile mockup is provided, how do you think this mobile site should look and function like?
    5. Imagine a secondary page, how would you think that looks like? How would you route pages from point A to point B?

    - Video Section

        - For the video section of the site, use this API source as your video. You do not have to build a video player, but you can open the link to Vimeo itself.

        - For every item in this json file, render the video section. Use the thumbnail that is provided in the API response if you can.

        - Vimeo Videos api (or use videos.json in the zip):


* **How to use:**
    - All links are inactive aside from the logo (which takes you to the home/landing page) and "Help" (on the navbar)
